# Exploratory_Data_Analysis_of_Rented_Bikes_in_Two_Cities

Rental bike sharing systems have been introduced in many cities worldwide to provide an accessible and sustainable mode of transport. The two datasets used contain the number of bikes rented at each hour in Seoul, South Korea (BikeSeoul.csv) and Washington, D.C., USA (BikeWashingtonDC.csv), together with corresponding meteorological and holiday data.

We considered these two cities as examples to explore the relationships between bike usage, weather, time of day and holidays. Understanding these relationships is important to eventually build appropriate statistical models to predict bike demand at various times of the year. These predictions can then be used, for example, to schedule bike maintenance.
